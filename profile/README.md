# MetacMed: Acoustic and mechanical metamaterials for biomedical and energy harvesting applications
The MetacMed project is a European Doctoral Network funded by the European Commission under the Horizon 2022 Marie Sklodowska-Curie Action (MSCA) for  2.02 Mln of Euro (plus > 1 Mln of Euro by UKRI & SERI)

## About MetacMed

MetacMed aims to link basic research on acoustic and mechanical metamaterials (MMs) to health and well-being issues. The team includes beneficiaries and associated partners who, if working separately, would not be able to make the planned advances in research and innovation. DCs will each consider ways in which human health can be improved using MMs, e.g. improvement in the resolution of biomedical ultrasound imaging for e.g. cancer diagnostics, the design of better spinal implants, monitoring of bone healing, and the use of insoles to aid human walking. Another area of interest is to develop MMs that can be used for energy harvesting, to better power e.g. medical devices, and reduce reliance on conventional power sources.
